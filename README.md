#### Like WhatsApp - But BETTER (way better)

## Installation and getting started
The installation process consists of 3 parts:
1) Server side set up
2) Ratings set up - detailed in this link: https://github.com/danmarom16/ChitChatRaitings/blob/master/README.md
3) Client side set up - detailed in this link: https://github.com/danmarom16/chit-chat#readme
